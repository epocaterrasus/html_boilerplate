    <h2>What is a planet?</h2>
        <p>In astronomy, a <strong>planet</strong> is a celestial body that orbits a star (like the sun) and meets three essential criteria:</p>

            <p><strong>Orbit:</strong> A planet must orbit around the star directly, meaning it follows a path around the star due to the star's gravitational pull.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Shape:</strong> A planet must have sufficient mass to shape itself into a nearly round shape, primarily due to its own gravitational force. This shape is known as hydrostatic equilibrium.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Clearing its orbit:</strong> A planet must have "cleared its orbit," which means it has become gravitationally dominant in its orbital region, and there are no other large bodies in its path or that share its orbital zone.</p>
            
            <p>Following these criteria, as defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), the solar system has eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Other objects, like dwarf planets (e.g., Pluto), asteroids, and comets, do not meet all of these criteria and are classified differently.</p>

    <h2>List of Planets of the Solar System</h2>

        <h3>Mercury</h3>
            <p>The closest planet to the sun and the smallest in the solar system. It has a heavily cratered surface and extreme temperature variations between its scorching daytime and freezing nighttime.</p>

        <h3>Venus</h3>
            <p>Similar in size and composition to Earth, often called Earth's "sister planet." It has a thick, toxic atmosphere and a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system.</p>
        
        <h3>Earth</h3>
            <p>Our home planet, the only one known to support life. It has a diverse environment with oceans, landmasses, and a protective atmosphere that sustains a wide variety of life forms.</p>

        <h3>Mars</h3>
            <p>Often called the "Red Planet" due to its rusty appearance. It has a thin atmosphere, ancient riverbeds, and polar ice caps. Scientists believe it might have had liquid water in the distant past, making it a focus of future space exploration.</p>

        <h3>Jupiter</h3>
            <p>The largest planet in our solar system, known for its immense size and powerful magnetic field. It is a gas giant composed mostly of hydrogen and helium and has a prominent system of colorful bands and swirling storms, including the famous Great Red Spot.</p>

        <h3>Saturn</h3>
            <p> Famous for its stunning ring system, which is made up of icy particles and debris. It is also a gas giant like Jupiter and has numerous moons, including the largest one, Titan.</p>

        <h3>Uranus</h3>
            <p>An ice giant with a faint ring system, tilted almost 98 degrees on its side, making it roll on its side as it orbits the sun. It has a unique blue-green color due to the presence of methane in its atmosphere.</p>

        <h3>Neptune</h3>
            <p>The farthest planet from the sun, also an ice giant. It has a deep blue color due to methane in its atmosphere. Neptune has strong winds and the fastest recorded wind speeds in the solar system.</p>
